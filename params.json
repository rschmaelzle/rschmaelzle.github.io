  "body": "### Welcome!\r\nMy research focuses on the psychological and neurobiological underpinnings of successful health and risk communication. This involves a radically interdisciplinary approach that integrates theories from communication science, neuroscience, and psychology. I believe that this combination has great potential to promote a better understanding of vitally important phenomena related to health – our greatest wealth.\r\nThanks for your interest in my work, and for visiting this site.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nRalf Schmälzle, PhD\r\nCommunication Neuroscience Lab\r\nAnnenberg School for Communication\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\r\nEmail: rschmaelzleATasc.upenn.edu\r\n",
