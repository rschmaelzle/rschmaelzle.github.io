  abstract = {This study introduces the concept of value-expressive communication and examines its relationship with behavioral intent. Value-expressive communication is conceptualized as the verbal output of a value-expressive attitude (Katz, 1960). Value-expressive communication about exercise is examined in relationship to strength of religious faith, exercise attitudes, and intentions to exercise among a sample of self-identified Christians. The data indicate that value-expressive communication and exercise attitudes is significantly associated with intentions to exercise. However, value-expressive communication was not significantly related to strength of religious faith. Suggestions for using value-expressive communication in health communication research and campaigns are discussed. (last week I didn't encounter anyone).},

  abstract =  {Background: People do not use condoms consistently but instead rely on intuition to identify sexual partners high at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The present study examined gender differences of intuitive impressions about HIV risk.
Methods: Male and female perceivers evaluated portraits of unacquainted male and female targets regarding their risk for HIV, trait characteristics (trust, responsibility, attractiveness, valence, arousal, and health), and willingness for interaction.
Results: Male targets were perceived as more risky than female targets for both perceiver genders. Furthermore, male perceivers reported higher HIV risk perception for both male and female targets than female perceivers. Multiple regression indicated gender differences in the association between person characteristics and HIV risk. In male targets, only trustworthiness predicts HIV risk. In female targets, however, HIV risk is related to trustworthiness, attractiveness, health, valence (for male perceivers), and arousal (for female perceivers).
Conclusion: The present findings characterize intuitive impressions of HIV risk and reveal differences according to both target and perceiver gender. Considering gender differences in intuitive judgments of HIV risk may help devise effective strategies by shifting the balance from feelings of risk toward a more rational mode of risk perception and the adoption of effective precautionary behaviors.},

The present fMRI study aimed to determine which neural structures selectively increase the incentive value of need-relevant stimuli in a thirst state. Towards this end, participants were scanned twice - either in a thirst or no-thirst state - while viewing pictures of beverages and chairs. As expected, thirst led to a selective increase in self-reported pleasantness and arousal by beverages. Increased responses to beverage as compared to chair stimuli were observed in the cingulate cortex, insular cortex, and the amygdala in the thirst state, which were absent in the no-thirst condition. Enhancing the incentive value of need-relevant cues in a thirst state is a key mechanism for motivating drinking behavior. Overall, distributed regions of the motive circuitry, which are also implicated in salience processing, craving, and interoception, provide a dynamic body-state dependent representation of stimulus value.}

In contrast, unpleasant and neutral picture processing did not vary as a function of threat-of-shock. Furthermore, in both the safety and threat-of-shock conditions, emotional pictures elicited an enlarged early posterior negativity and late positive potential.

Pleasant stimuli mismatching the current state of anticipatory anxiety apparently draw more attentional resources.},

In the following explicit condition, participants evaluated the HIV risk for each presented person.

Importantly, neural regions responding to explicit HIV risk judgments were also enhanced in the implicit condition, suggesting a neural mechanism for intuitive impressions of riskiness.

Prior theorizing and research in communication has primarily addressed Marr's computational level (why), but has less frequently investigated algorithmic (what) or implementation (how all communication phenomena emerge from and rely on biological processes) explanations. Here, we introduce Marr's framework and apply it to three research domains in communication science - audience research, persuasion, and social comparisons - to demonstrate what a unifying framework for explaining communication across the levels of why, what, and how can look like, and how Marr's framework speaks to and receives input from all subfields of communication inquiry.},

Here we examine how the brains of young adults - a key target group for alcohol prevention - 'tune in' to real-life health prevention messages about risky alcohol use. In a first study, a large sample of authentic public service announcements (PSAs) targeting the risks of alcohol was characterized using established measures of message effectiveness. In the main study, we used inter-subject correlation analysis of fMRI data to examine brain responses to more and less effective PSAs in a sample of young adults. We find that more effective messages command more similar responses within widespread brain regions, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, insulae, and precuneus. In previous research these regions have been related to narrative engagement, self-relevance, and attention towards salient stimuli. The present study thus suggests that more effective health prevention messages have greater 'neural reach', i.e. they engage the brains of audience members' more widely. This work outlines a promising strategy for assessing the effects of health communication at a neural level.},

We focused on brain activity in meta-analytically defined regions associated with these three processes as 40 adolescent nonsmokers viewed advertisements from ?The Real Cost? antismoking campaign. Perceived message effectiveness was positively associated with brain activity in the hypothesized social processing regions and marginally associated with brain activity in self-relevance regions, but not associated with brain activity in valuation regions. By contrast, intentions to share the messages were not associated with neural response in these 3 systems. In contrast to previous neuroimaging studies with adult subjects, our findings highlight the role of social cognition in adolescent processing of persuasive messages. We discuss the possibility that the mental processes responsive to effective and shareworthy messages may reflect developmental processes pertinent to media effects.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Interpersonal communication can reinforce media effects on health behavior. Recent studies have shown that brain activity in the medial prefrontal cortex during message exposure can predict message-consistent behavior change. Key next steps include examining the relationship between neural responses to ads and measures of interpersonal message retransmission that can be collected at scale. METHODS: Neuroimaging, self-report, and automated linguistic measures were utilized to investigate the relationships between neural responses to tobacco prevention messages, sharing engagement, and smoking-relevant belief changes. Thirty-seven adolescent nonsmokers viewed 12 ads from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's ``The Real Cost'' campaign during a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan session (2015-2016). Data were analyzed between 2016 and 2017. The extent that participants talked in detail about the main message of the ads, or sharing engagement, was measured through transcripts of participants' subsequent verbal descriptions using automated linguistic coding. Beliefs about the consequences of smoking were measured before and after the main experiment using surveys. RESULTS: Increased brain activation in self- and value-related subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex during message exposure was associated with subsequent sharing engagement when participants verbally talked about the ads. In addition, sharing engagement was significantly associated with changes in participants' beliefs about the social consequences of smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Neural activity in self- and value-related subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex during exposure to ``The Real Cost'' campaign was associated with subsequent sharing engagement, which in turn was related to social belief change. These results provide new insights into the link between neurocognitive responses to ads, the content of interpersonal sharing, and downstream health-relevant outcomes. SUPPLEMENT INFORMATION: This article is part of a supplement entitled Fifth Anniversary Retrospective of ``The Real Cost,'' the Food and Drug Administration's Historic Youth Smoking Prevention Media Campaign, which is sponsored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.},

Contrary to the dominant models of biased reasoning, our results on feedback reception suggest that people respond adaptively to health risk feedback. Furthermore, we study changes in the perception of health risk across time and their associated effects on the onset, maintenance, and cessation of health-relevant behaviors. In current research, we try to utilize methods from affective neuroscience for assessing affective and intuitive processes relevant to personal feelings of risk.

The present studies examined neural correlates for first impressions of HIV risk and determined the association of perceived HIV risk with other trait characteristics. Participants were presented with 120 self-portraits retrieved from a popular online photo-sharing community (www.flickr.com). Factor analysis of various explicit ratings of trait characteristics yielded two orthogonal factors: (1) a 'valence-approach' factor encompassing perceived attractiveness, healthiness, valence, and approach tendencies, and (2) a 'safeness' factor, entailing judgments of HIV risk, trustworthiness, and responsibility. These findings suggest that HIV risk ratings systematically relate to cardinal features of a high-risk HIV stereotype. Furthermore, event-related brain potential recordings revealed neural correlates of first impressions about HIV risk. Target persons perceived as risky elicited a differential brain response in a time window from 220-340 ms and an increased late positive potential in a time window from 350-700 ms compared to those perceived as safe. These data suggest that impressions about HIV risk can be formed in a split second and despite a lack of information about the actual risk profile. Findings of neural correlates of risk impressions and their relationship to key features of the HIV risk stereotype are discussed in the context of the 'risk as feelings' theory.},

Previous efforts to operationalize and measure post-national citizenship identities leave it open how people's stances on different issues are related and suffer from a variety of theoretical and methodological shortcomings regarding the nature of political attitudes and ideologies. A recently proposed approach conceptualizes ideologies as networks of causally connected evaluative reactions to individual issues. Individual evaluative reactions form the nodes in a network model, and these nodes can influence each other via linked edges, thereby giving rise to a dynamic thoughts system of networked political and identity-related views. To examine this system at large, we apply network analysis to data from the European Values Study. Specifically, we investigate 33 evaluative reactions regarding national and supra-national identity, diversity, global empathy, global environmentalism, immigration, and supra-national politics. The results reveal a strongly connected network of citizenship identity-related attitudes. A community analysis reveals larger clusters of strongly related evaluative reactions, which are connected via bridges and hub nodes. Centrality analysis identifies evaluative reactions that are strategically positioned in the network, and network simulations indicate that persuasion attempts targeted at such nodes have greater potential to influence the larger citizenship identity than changes of more peripheral attitude nodes. We lastly show that socio-demographic characteristics are not only associated with the overall level of post-national citizenship, but also with the network structure, suggesting that these structural differences can affect the network function as people develop national or post-national citizenship identities, or respond to external events. These results provide new insights into the structure of post-national identities and the mechanism how post-national identities might evolve. We end with a discussion of future opportunities to study networked attitudes in the context of civic and citizenship education.},

  abstract = {Recent theoretical models of risk perception emphasize the role of intuitive and affective processes. Empirical evidence, however, remains scarce. In the present dissertation event-related brain potentials (ERP) are used as a sensitive tool to shed light on the role of intuition in health risk perception. Three studies are presented in which participants viewed pictures of unknown persons in the context of a HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) risk perception paradigm while ERPs were recorded. This strategy enabled the demonstration of key processing characteristics of intuition: speed, affective evaluation, and implicitness. In the first study, participants judged the HIV risk of 120 persons based on facial appearance. Results showed enlarged positive brain potentials for risky faces in a time window from 350 - 650 ms. The second study added important evidence by showing that these results are not confined to facial stimuli. Using naturalistic photographs of real persons that resemble real life encounters and pictures used on internet dating platforms, it was established that risky persons prompt larger LPPs (late positive potentials), starting after approximately 300 ms. Based on the results of these two studies it is concluded that HIV risk of unknown persons is assessed intuitively. Discriminating among risky and safe stimuli in a split second provides strong evidence for intuitive processing regarding the key characteristic of speed. Furthermore, both studies provided supportive evidence for affective evaluation, another hallmark feature of intuitive processing. Risky stimuli were associated with enlarged LPPs, a component known to be sensitive to the intrinsic affective relevance of stimuli. The third study incorporated an implicit condition, allowing risk-related processing differences to be assessed in the absence of external task demands pertaining to HIV risk judgment. By showing that ERPs from the implicit condition - obtained during a quick glimpse and with no intention to evaluate risk - are related to later reports of HIV risk, these results provide strong evidence for the intuitive and incidental character of risk perception, another key feature of intuition. Moreover, ERP results from a subsequent explicit condition replicated previous findings, providing additional evidence for the intuitive features of speed and affective evaluation.Considering previous findings in affective neuroscience, it is proposed that persons judged as risky already attain a higher saliency early on during information processing and guide selective attention processes. These findings have implications for theoretical models of health risk perception and point to intuitive influences in everyday health risk perception.},

  abstract =  {Field studies on HIV risk suggest that people may rely on impressions they have about the safety of their partner at the dispense of more objective risk protection strategies. In this study, ERP recordings were used to investigate the brain mechanisms that give rise to such impressions. First, in an implicit condition, participants viewed a series of photographs of unacquainted persons while performing a task that did not mention HIV risk. Second, in an explicit condition, participants estimated the HIV risk for each presented person. Dense sensor EEG was recorded during the implicit and explicit conditions. In the analysis, explicit risk ratings were used to categorize ERP data from the implicit and explicit conditions into low and high HIV risk categories. The results reveal implicit ERP differences on the basis of subsequent ratings of HIV risk. Specifically, the processing of risky individuals was associated with an early occipital negativity (240-300 ms) and a subsequent central positivity between 430 and 530 ms compared to safe. A similar ERP modulation emerged in the explicit condition for the central positivity component between 430 and 530 ms. A subsequent late positive potential component between 550 and 800 ms was specifically enhanced for risky persons in the explicit rating condition while not modulated in the implicit condition. Furthermore, ratings of HIV risk correlated substantially with ratings of trustworthiness and responsibility. Taken together, these observations provide evidence for theories of intuitive risk perception, which, in the case of HIV risk, seem to operate via appearance-based stereotypic inferences.},

  abstract =  {Research indicates that many people do not use condoms consistently but rather rely on illusory control strategies for avoiding an infection with HIV. Preliminary evidence suggests that people form impressions of a partner's HIV risk based on his or her physical appearance. To examine the neural correlates of such appearance-based HIV risk impressions, event-related potentials were recorded while participants viewed portraits of unacquainted persons. Participants' explicit HIV risk ratings for each of the presented unacquainted persons were used to form categories of low and high HIV risk persons. Results showed that risky, compared to safe persons elicited distinct event-related potential (ERP) modulations. Viewing risky persons was associated with an increased positivity over right frontal regions between 180 and 240 ms. This suggests that impressions related to HIV risk occur rapidly, presumably reflecting automatic person evaluations eluding introspection. In a time window between 450 and 600 ms, risky persons elicited an increased late positive potential. Consistent with previous findings reporting augmented late positive potentials (LPP) amplitudes to affectively significant stimuli, the results support the assumption that risky faces draw more attention resources. These findings are in accordance with the 'risk as feeling' notion.},

Intersubject correlation (ISC) of neural time courses was used to assess how similarly the brains of viewers responded to the TV report. We found enhanced intersubject correlations among viewers with high-risk perception in the anterior cingulate, a region which classical fMRI studies associated with the appraisal of threatening information. By contrast, neural coupling in sensory-perceptual regions was similar for the high and low H1N1-risk perception groups. These results demonstrate a novel methodology for understanding how real-life health messages are processed in the human brain, with particular emphasis on the role of emotion and differences in risk perceptions.},

Here we assess audience-wide functional brain dynamics during listening to speeches of varying rhetorical quality. The speeches were given by German politicians and evaluated as rhetorically powerful or weak. Listening to each of the speeches induced similar neural response time courses, as measured by inter-subject correlation analysis, in widespread brain regions involved in spoken language processing. Crucially, alignment of the time course across listeners was stronger for rhetorically powerful speeches, especially for bilateral regions of the superior temporal gyri and medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, during powerful speeches, listeners as a group are more coupled to each other, suggesting that powerful speeches are more potent in taking control of the listeners' brain responses. Weaker speeches were processed more heterogeneously, although they still prompted substantially correlated responses. These patterns of coupled neural responses bear resemblance to metaphors of resonance, which are often invoked in discussions of speech impact, and contribute to the literature on auditory attention under natural circumstances. Overall, this approach opens up possibilities for research on the neural mechanisms mediating the reception of entertaining or persuasive messages.}

Furthermore, using objectively logged friendship network data, we examine how individual variability in brain reactivity to social exclusion relates to the density of participants' friendship networks, an important aspect of social network structure. We find increased connectivity within a set of regions previously identified as a mentalizing system during exclusion relative to inclusion. These results are consistent across the regions of interest as well as a whole-brain analysis. Next, examining how social network characteristics are associated with task-based connectivity dynamics, participants who showed greater changes in connectivity within the mentalizing system when socially excluded by peers had less dense friendship networks. This work provides novel insight to understand how distributed brain systems respond to social and emotional challenges, and how such brain dynamics might vary based on broader social network characteristics.},

One powerful way to tap into aspects of fMRI reliability is via the inter-subject correlation (ISC) approach, which exposes different viewers to the same time-locked naturalistic stimulus and assesses the similarity of neural time series. Here we examined the correlations of fMRI time series from 24 participants who watched the same movie clips across three repetitions. This enabled us to examine inter-subject correlations, intra-subject correlations, and correlations between aggregated time series, which we link to the notions of inter-rater reliability, stability, and consistency. In primary visual cortex we found average pairwise inter-subject correlations of about r = 0.3, and intra-subject correlations of similar magnitude. Aggregation across subjects increased inter-subject (inter-group) correlations to r = 0.87, and additional intra-subject averaging before cross-subject aggregation yielded correlations of r = 0.93. Computing the same analyses for parietal (visuospatial network) and cingulate cortices (saliency network) revealed a gradient of decreasing ISC from primary visual to higher visual to post-perceptual regions. These latter regions also benefitted most from the increased reliability due to aggregation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of this link between neural process similarity and psychometric conceptions of inter-rater reliability, stability, and internal consistency.},

We exposed a sample of smokers to anti-smoking web-banner messages from a real-world campaign while measuring message-evoked brain response patterns via fMRI, and we also obtained subjective evaluations of each banner. Neural indices were derived based on i) message-evoked activity in specific brain regions and ii) spatially distributed response patterns, both selected based on prior research and theoretical considerations. Next, we connected the neural and subjective data with an independent, objective outcome of message success, that is the per- banner click-through rate in the real-world campaign. Results show that messages evoking brain responses more similar to signatures of negative emotion and vividness had lower online click-through-rates. This strategy helps to connect and integrate the rapidly growing body of knowledge about brain function with formative research and outcome evaluation of health campaigns, and could ultimately further disease prevention efforts.},

Despite its prevalence in media psychology, limited work has examined suspense from a media neuroscience perspective, and thus the biological underpinnings of suspense remain unknown. Here we examine continuous brain responses of 494 viewers watching a suspenseful movie. To create a time-resolved measure of the degree to which a movie aligns audience-wide brain responses, we computed dynamic inter-subject correlations of fMRI time series among all viewers using sliding-window analysis. In parallel, we captured in-the-moment reports of suspense in an independent sample via continuous response measurement (CRM). We find that dynamic ISC over the course of the movie tracks well with the reported suspense in the CRM sample, particularly in regions associated with emotional salience and higher cognitive processes. These results are compatible with theoretical views on motivated attention and psychological tension. The finding that fMRI-based audience response measurement relates to audience reports of suspense creates new opportunities for research on the mechanisms of suspense and other entertainment phenomena and has applied potential for measuring audience responses in a nonreactive and objective fashion.},

Participants viewed a continuous stream of food and flower images while dense sensor ERPs were recorded. As revealed by distinct ERP modulations in relatively earlier and later time windows, deprivation affected the processing of food and flower pictures. Between 300 and 360 ms, food pictures were associated with enlarged occipito-temporal negativity and centro-parietal positivity in deprived compared to satiated state. Of main interest, in a later time window (450-600 ms), deprivation increased amplitudes of the late positive potential elicited by food pictures. Conversely, flower processing varied by motivational state with decreased positive potentials in the deprived state. Minimum-Norm analyses provided further evidence that deprivation enhanced visual attention to food cues in later processing stages. From the perspective of motivated attention, hunger may induce a heightened state of attention for food stimuli in a processing stage related to stimulus recognition and focused attention.},

Unexpectedly, both partners' reports of partner disconfirmation were positively associated with their partners' reports of joint PA. Only one statistically significant sex difference emerged.

This problem is particularly acute for video-based media, where coders often have to take extensive time and energy to watch and interpret dynamic content. Here we present a Character-Recognition-Tool (CRT) that enables communication scholars to quickly process large amounts of video data to identify occurrences of specific predefined characters using facial recognition and matching. This paper presents the CRT and provides evidence for its validity. The CRT can automate the coding process of onscreen characters while following recommendations that computational tools be scalable, adaptable for novice programmers, and open source to allow for replication.},

Previous studies reveal that when humans listen to the same story told in their native language, their brain activity becomes temporally aligned. This story-evoked alignment of inter-subjective brain processes holds great theoretical significance as it points to neural commonalities that underlie communication. Yet, does this collective alignment of brains transcend linguistic boundaries? Analyzing brain responses of French, English, and Chinese speakers exposed to their respective renditions of Le Petit Prince, this study reveals alignment across the brain's default mode network. This network, which is implicated in sense-making and social cognition, exhibits similar spatio-temporal responses regardless of language, suggesting a universal processing framework. Our findings highlight the covert connection stories forge between diverse brains. This underscores the fundamental neurocognitive architecture underlying story processing and the collective impact of stories on human cognition and communication.},

These similar, and thus shared audience responses constitute the recruitment of sensory, perceptual, and higher-level neurocognitive processes, which occur separately in the brain of each individual, but in a collectively shared fashion across the audience. A method called inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis allows to reveal these shared responses. This manuscript introduces a theoretical model of brain function that explains why shared brain responses occur and how they emerge along a gradient from sensation to cognition as individuals process the same message content. This model makes results from ISC-based studies more interpretable from a communication perspective, helps organize the results from existing studies across different subfields, and generates testable predictions. The article discusses how research at the nexus of media, audience research, and neuroscience contributes to and advances communication theory.},

  abstract = {Background: Communication campaigns utilizing social media can raise public awareness, but they are difficult to sustain. One barrier is the need to constantly generate and post novel, yet on-topic messages, which creates a resource-intensive bottleneck.

Objective: Here, we harness the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to build a system that can generate a large number of candidate messages, which could be used for a campaign. The topic of folic acid, a B-vitamin that helps prevent major birth defects, serves as an example, but the system can work with other topics as well.

Methods: We used the Generative-Pre-trained-Transformer-2 (GPT2) architecture, a machine learning model trained on a large natural language corpus, and fine tuned it using a dataset of auto-downloaded tweets about #folicacid. The fine tuned model was then used as a message engine, that is to create new messages about this topic. We carried out an online study to gauge how human raters evaluate the AI-generated tweet messages compared to original, human-crafted messages.

Results: We find that the Folic Acid Message Engine can easily create several hundreds of new messages that appear natural to humans. Online raters evaluated the clarity and quality of a selected sample AI-generated tweets as on par with human-generated ones. Overall, these results show that it is feasible to use such a message engine to suggest messages for online campaigns.

Conclusions: The message engine can serve as a starting point for more sophisticated AI-guided message creation systems for health communication. Beyond the practical potential of such systems for campaigns in the age of social media, they also hold great scientific potential for quantitative analysis of message characteristics that promote successful communication. We discuss future developments and obvious ethical challenges that need to be addressed as AI technologies for health persuasion enter the stage.},

This study tested the potential of a new mobile, relatively easy-to-mount , and highly affordable device for electroencephalography (EEG) measurement - the Muse EEG system - combined with a free, open-source platform for ERP recording and analysis. Specifically, we compared ERPs to affective visual stimuli - representative of the kinds of engaging content that pervades modern social media. Our results confirm that the Muse system provides robust visual ERPs, highly reliable across two samples. Although there was no difference between ERPs to moderately positive and neutral stimuli in the expected time windows (200-300 ms, 400-600 ms), an exploratory analysis revealed some evidence for differential processing of positive vs. neutral images at the right temporal sensor site (TP10). Additionally, a compliance gaining manipulation in participant instructions significantly improved data quality. These results support using the Muse EEG system in large-scale studies examining brain responses to screen media. They also suggest an easy social influence tactic that can enhance data quality as communication neuroscience is scaled up. The availability of a mobile EEG system for 250 U.S. dollars makes it possible to incorporate neuroimaging into various communication paradigms beyond visual communication.},

In further analyses, we linked ISC to subsequent drinking behavior change and used time-resolved EEG-ISC to model functional neuroimaging data (fMRI) of an independent audience. The EEG measure was not only related to sensory-perceptual brain regions, but also to regions previously related to successful messaging, i.e., cortical midline regions and the insula. The findings suggest EEG-ISC as a marker for audience engagement and effectiveness of naturalistic health messages, which could quantify the impact of mass communication within the brains of small target audiences.},

One important predictor of engagement in healthy behavior is support from one's romantic partner. However, messages from partners may fail to motivate healthy behavior if they threaten recipients face and cause reactance. The present study examines face-threatening acts (FTAs) and face management strategies (FMSs) in conversations between romantic couples and their associations with reactance, healthy eating, and PA behaviors. Cohabitating couples (N = 70) were recruited, and one member of the couple completed a 10-day diary survey in which they reported on daily memorable conversations they had with their partner about PA and/or healthy eating. Participants completed measures of positive and negative face threat, as well as the extent to which they engaged in healthy eating and PA that day. Trained raters assessed reported conversations for positive and negative face threat as well as positive and negative FMSs. Results indicate that both participant and trained raters' reports of positive face threat were associated with increased reactance, whereas only participants' reports of negative face threat were associated with increased reactance. Both positive and negative FMSs were associated with reduced reactance. Reactance was negatively associated with healthy eating and PA. Results are discussed in terms of implications for reactance and politeness theories, as well as pragmatic implications for the millions of partnered individuals in the U.S. seeking to improve their health.},

  abstract = {Every day, the world of media is at our fingertips, whether it is watching movies, listening to the radio, or browsing online media. On average, people spend over 8 hours per day consuming messages from the mass media, amounting to a total lifetime dose of more than 20 years in which conceptual content stimulates our brains. Effects from this flood of information range from short-term attention bursts (e.g., by breaking news features or viral "memes") to life-long memories (e.g., of one's favorite childhood movie), and from micro-level impacts on an individual's memory, attitudes, and behaviors to macro-level effects on nations or generations. The modern study of media's influence on society dates back to the 1940s. This body of mass communication scholarship has largely asked, "what is media's effect on the individual?" Around the time of the cognitive revolution, media psychologists began to ask, "what cognitive processes are involved in media processing?" More recently, neuroimaging researchers started using real-life media as stimuli to examine perception and cognition under more natural conditions. Such research asks: "what can media tell us about brain function?" With some exceptions, these bodies of scholarship often talk past each other. An integration offers new insights into the neurocognitive mechanisms through which media affect single individuals and entire audiences. However, this endeavor faces the same challenges as all interdisciplinary approaches: Researchers with different backgrounds have different levels of expertise, goals, and foci. For instance, neuroimaging researchers label media stimuli as "naturalistic" although they are in many ways rather artificial. Similarly, media experts are typically unfamiliar with the brain. Neither media creators nor neuroscientifically oriented researchers approach media effects from a social scientific perspective, which is the domain of yet another species. In this article, we provide an overview of approaches and traditions to studying media, and we review the emerging literature that aims to connect these streams. We introduce an organizing scheme that connects the causal paths from media content -> brain responses -> media effects and discuss network control theory as a promising framework to integrate media content, reception, and effects analyses.},

This raises the question whether this event-related brain potential (ERP) response is specific to contagious life-threatening diseases or a general mechanism triggered by life-threatening but non-contagious diseases. In the present study, we recorded dense sensor EEG while participants (N = 36) evaluated photographs of unacquainted individuals for either HIV or leukemia risk. The ERP results replicated previous findings revealing earlier and later differential brain responses towards individuals perceived as high risk for HIV. However, there were no significant ERP differences for high vs. low leukemia risk. Rather than reflecting a generic response to disease, the present findings suggest that intuitive judgments of HIV risk are at least in part specific to sexually transmitted diseases.},

To move towards real-word applications, however, challenges regarding costs, lab restraints, and slow data acquisition need to be addressed.

Portable EEG was recorded while participants viewed strong and weak video health messages against risky alcohol use. Participants viewed the messages either individually or in a focus group-like setting with six participants simultaneously. For both viewing conditions, three correlated components were extracted. The topographies of these components showed high spatial correlation with previous high-density EEG results. Moreover, ISC was strongly enhanced when viewing strong as compared to weak health messages in both the group and individual viewing condition. The findings suggest that ISC analysis shows sensitivity to message strength, even in a group setting using low-density portable EEG. Measuring brain responses to messages in group settings is more efficient and scalable beyond the laboratory. Overall, these results support a translational perspective for the use of neuroscientific measures in health message development.},

  abstract = {Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) over the last decade demonstrate that machines can exhibit communicative behavior and influence how humans think, feel, and behave. In fact, the recent development of ChatGPT has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to generate high-quality communication content at scale and across domains, suggesting that they will be increasingly used in practice. However, many questions remain about how knowing the source of the messages influences recipients' evaluation of and preference for AI-generated messages compared to human-generated messages. This paper investigated this topic in the context of vaping prevention messaging. In Study 1, which was pre-registered, we examined the influence of source disclosure on people's evaluation of AI-generated health prevention messages compared to human-generated messages. We found that source disclosure (i.e., labeling the source of a message as AI vs. human) significantly impacted the evaluation of the messages but did not significantly alter message rankings. In a follow-up study (Study 2), we examined how the influence of source disclosure may vary by the participants' negative attitudes towards AI. We found a significant moderating effect of negative attitudes towards AI on message evaluation, but not for message selection. However, for those with moderate levels of negative attitudes towards AI, source disclosure decreased the preference for AI-generated messages. Overall, the results of this series of studies showed a slight bias against AI-generated messages once the source was disclosed, adding to the emerging area of study that lies at the intersection of AI and communication.},

  year     = {2024},
  abstract = {When members of an audience process the same messages, such as a movie, they respond similarly. Recent work using neuroimaging has shown that brain responses to a movie are remarkably similar across people who are watching the movie. These similar brain responses emerge because the movie recruits brain systems involved in sensory processing (e.g., responding to the flickering lights on screen), perceptual processes (e.g., identifying the characters' faces), and social-cognitive processes (e.g., following and understanding the story, social, and affective responses) - separately in each individual brain, but collectively across the entire audience. What has not been studied, however, is whether the brains of identical twins, who maximize inter-subjective similarity due to shared genetic and environmental factors, would respond in a more twin-like fashion at the neural level, exhibiting more similar responses during movie viewing compared to non-twins. To address this question, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a sample of 200 identical twins who watched a popular and socially engaging short film: Pixar's Partly Cloudy. We find that twin-pairs exhibit more strongly aligned brain responses compared to non-twin participants. Both, twin-pairs as well as non-twin-pairs, responded very similarly with shared responses to the movie. Additionally, the shared responses measured in the current study were highly correlated with shared brain responses from a previous sample watching the same movie. These results support our prediction that pre-existing similarities among twin-pairs lead to higher brain-to-brain coupling during movie reception. Together with research from clinical and developmental samples watching social movies, these results underscore the potential of using media to engage social-cognitive processes and examine their live operations in the human brain via neurocognitive methods. Moreover, they suggest that brain-to-brain similarities in response to movies contain information about similarities at the social level, allowing them to predict kinship status, friendship, or other social factors.},

  abstract = {Introduction: This study introduces and examines the potential of an AI system to generate health awareness messages. The topic of folic acid, a vitamin that is critical during pregnancy, served as a test case.
Method: We used prompt engineering to generate awareness messages about folic acid and compared them to the most retweeted human-generated messages via human evaluation with an university sample and another sample comprising of young adult women. We also conducted computational text analysis to examine the similarities between the AI-generated messages and human generated tweets in terms of content and semantic structure.
Results: The results showed that AI-generated messages ranked higher in message quality and clarity across both samples. The computational analyses revealed that the AI generated messages were on par with human-generated ones in terms of sentiment, reading ease, and semantic content.
Discussion: Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of large language models for message generation. Theoretical, practical, and ethical implications are discussed},

  abstract = {Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) over the last decade demonstrate that machines can exhibit communicative behavior and influence how humans think, feel, and behave. In fact, the recent development of ChatGPT has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to generate high-quality communication content at scale and across domains, suggesting that they will be increasingly used in practice. However, many questions remain about how knowing the source of the messages influences recipients' evaluation of and preference for AI-generated messages compared to human-generated messages. This paper investigated this topic in the context of vaping prevention messaging. In Study 1, which was pre-registered, we examined the influence of source disclosure on people's evaluation of AI-generated health prevention messages compared to human-generated messages. We found that source disclosure (i.e., labeling the source of a message as AI vs. human) significantly impacted the evaluation of the messages but did not significantly alter message rankings. In a follow-up study (Study 2), we examined how the influence of source disclosure may vary by the participants' negative attitudes towards AI. We found a significant moderating effect of negative attitudes towards AI on message evaluation, but not for message selection. However, for those with moderate levels of negative attitudes towards AI, source disclosure decreased the preference for AI-generated messages. Overall, the results of this series of studies showed a slight bias against AI-generated messages once the source was disclosed, adding to the emerging area of study that lies at the intersection of AI and communication.},

  abstract = {In contemporary urban environments, advertisements are ubiquitous, capturing the attention of individuals navigating through cityscapes. This study simulates this situation by using VR as an advertising research tool and combining it with eye-tracking to rigorously assess attention to and retention of visual advertisements. Specifically, participants drove through a virtual city with 40 AI-generated, experimentally manipulated, and randomly assigned advertisements (20 commercial, 20 health) distributed throughout. Our results confirm theoretical predictions about the link between exposure, visual attention, and incidental memory. Specifically, we found that attended ads are likely to be recalled and recognized, and concurrent task demands (counting sales signs) decreased visual attention and subsequent recall and recognition of the ads. Finally, we identify the influence of ad placement in the city as a very important but previously hard-to-study factor influencing advertising effects. This paradigm offers great flexibility for biometric advertising research and can be adapted to varying contexts, including highways, airports, and subway stations, and theoretically manipulate other variables. Moreover, considering the metaverse as a next-generation advertising environment, our work demonstrates how causal mechanisms can be identified in ways that are of equally high interest to both theoretical as well as applied advertising research.},

The field traces its origins to the early 20th century and can be linked with important historical paradigmatic developments in psychology including behaviorism and the cognitive revolution. As the other entries in this handbook demonstrate, modern media psychological research elevates cognition - the psychological processes related to acquiring, processing and storing information - as a primary object of study. Foregrounding the field?s focus on how media affect cognition, we ask several questions: how did we decide to do it, how do we do it, and how are we doing at doing it? To answer these questions, this chapter includes a brief history of landmark developments in the field with a key focus on the transition from behaviorism to cognitivism. Subsequently, we discuss the modern-day methodological toolkit for mapping cognitive processes to self-report, behavioral, and neurophysiological measures. Based on an analysis of the media psychological literature from the past decade, we conclude that the term cognition has increasingly become a mentalistic concept, i.e. using survey-based introspections about mental processes that are largely untethered from their underlying cognitive constructs. With this in mind, we articulate a path forward to re-couple media psychology research with cognition proper via methodologies like computational modeling, neurophysiological measurements, and behavioral studies.},

We introduced an inception-style manipulation where billboards initially overlooked by participants were covertly reintroduced based on real-time gaze tracking. Our findings show this algorithmic manipulation, undetected by participants, significantly boosted message memory retention for the targeted messages. This study reveals a path of media influence, demonstrating how undetected algorithmic manipulations can shape individual and collective memory.

Objective: This study examined characteristics of AI vs. human-generated road safety messages for a potential roadside billboard campaign in the United Arab Emirates.
Method: The study includes a computational analysis and an online evaluation with 186 participants from the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), comparing messages generated by AI with those created by humans. To achieve this, a current-state AI model (GPT-4) was utilized to generate 15 road safety messages, while three human experts created another set of 15 messages. Computational text analysis was employed to examine these messages, followed by an online study in which human participants evaluated all messages based on message clarity and message quality.
Results: The computational analysis revealed that AI-generated messages exhibited more positive sentiment with no significant differences in terms of readability/text difficulty. Participants evaluated both AI- and human-generated messages highly in terms of message quality and clarity, but human-generated messages were rated as slightly and significantly higher in terms of clarity. 
Conclusion: These results add to a rapidly growing body of research demonstrating that AI-generated messages can augment public communication campaigns and point towards the need to assess how diverse, international audiences, respond to AI-generated content.},

However, studies to date focus on text-based conversational agents (CA) with limited embodiment, restricting our understanding of how social influence principles, such as physical similarity, apply to AI agents (i.e., artificial social influence). We address this gap by leveraging latest advances in AI (large language models) and combining them with immersive virtual reality (VR). Specifically, we built VR-ECAs, or embodied conversational agents that can engage in turn-taking conversations with humans about health-related topics in a virtual environment. Then we manipulated interpersonal similarity via gender matching and examined its effects on biobehavioral (i.e., gaze), social (e.g., agent likeability), and behavioral outcomes (i.e., healthy snack selection). We observed an interaction effect between agent and participant gender on biobehavioral outcomes: discussing health with opposite-gender agents tended to enhance gaze duration, with the effect stronger for male participants compared to their female counterparts. A similar directional pattern was observed for healthy snack selection. In addition, female participants liked the VR-ECAs more than their male counterparts, regardless of the VR-ECAs' gender. Finally, participants experienced greater presence while conversing with embodied agents than chatting with text-only agents. Overall, our findings highlight embodiment as a crucial factor of AI's influence on human behavior, and our paradigm enables new experimental research at the intersection of social influence, human-AI communication, and immersive virtual reality (VR).},

This position paper proposes a VR-based methodological framework that leverages physiological and behavioural measurements to study user interactions with LLM-driven IVAs over time. To illustrate how this framework supports both implementation and evaluation of proactive behaviors, we present a case study focused on IVAs' rapport-building behaviors in the context of health counseling. This VR-based approach offers researchers a flexible and multimodal experimental platform that combines high realism and exquisite measurement opportunities to examine social and cognitive processes underlying human-IVA interactions.},

In a between-subjects design, three audience groups watched either the full version (audio-video) of a suspenseful short movie (Love Field) or a video-only version or listened to the audio track only. Audience responses were assessed with a combination of continuous response measurement (CRM) and psychophysiological measures, comprising heart rate (i.e., inter-beat interval, IBI), pulse volume amplitude (PVA), and skin conductance level (SCL). Frame-by-frame content coding was performed to identify distinct plot segments and musical moods (tense vs. relaxing) and mark the critical visual and auditory events that directed the audience's inferences about the nature of the plot and elicited specific outcome expectations. Results showed that continuous self-report data and objective physiological measures were largely dissociated, suggesting different processing modalities. Tense music alone induced feelings of suspense (CRM) even in the absence of any clues about story content. Overall, the audio-only version led to the highest arousal levels, as indicated by SCL and PVA, while the video-only version led to the lowest arousal levels. IBI data revealed short-term heart rate deceleration responses to salient narrative clues that could be interpreted in terms of heightened attention and cognitive resource allocation. Results are discussed in the light of a multidimensional framework of tension and suspense and a terminological differentiation of both concepts.},

  abstract = {Inferring emotions from others' non-verbal behavior is a pervasive and fundamental task in social interactions. Typically, real-life encounters imply the co-location of interactants, i.e., their embodiment within a shared spatial-temporal continuum in which the trajectories of the interaction partner's Expressive Body Movement (EBM) create mutual social affordances. Shared Virtual Environments (SVEs) and Virtual Characters (VCs) are increasingly used to study social perception, allowing to reconcile experimental stimulus control with ecological validity. However, it remains unclear whether display modalities that enable co-presence have an impact on observers responses to VCs' expressive behaviors. Drawing upon ecological approaches to social perception, we reasoned that sharing the space with a VC should amplify affordances as compared to a screen display, and consequently alter observers' perceptions of EBM in terms of judgment certainty, hit rates, perceived expressive qualities (arousal and valence), and resulting approach and avoidance tendencies. In a between-subject design, we compared the perception of 54 10-s animations of VCs performing three daily activities (painting, mopping, sanding) in three emotional states (angry, happy, sad)?either displayed in 3D as a co-located VC moving in shared space, or as a 2D replay on a screen that was also placed in the SVEs. Results confirm the effective experimental control of the variable of interest, showing that perceived co-presence was significantly affected by the display modality, while perceived realism and immersion showed no difference. Spatial presence and social presence showed marginal effects. Results suggest that the display modality had a minimal effect on emotion perception. A weak effect was found for the expression 'happy,' for which unbiased hit rates were higher in the 3D condition. Importantly, low hit rates were observed for all three emotion categories. However, observers judgments significantly correlated for category assignment and across all rating dimensions, indicating universal decoding principles. While category assignment was erroneous, though, ratings of valence and arousal were consistent with expectations derived from emotion theory. The study demonstrates the value of animated VCs in emotion perception studies and raises new questions regarding the validity of category-based emotion recognition measures.},

  abstract = {Exposure is key to message effects. No effects can ensue if a health, political, or commercial message is not noticed. Yet, existing research in communication, advertising, and related disciplines often measures opportunities for exposure at an aggregate level, whereas knowing whether recipients were actually exposed to a message requires a micro-level approach. Micro-level research, on the other hand, focuses on message processing and retention, takes place under highly controlled laboratory conditions with forced message exposure, and largely ignores how recipients attend selectively to messages under more natural conditions. Eye-tracking enables us to assess actual exposure, but its previous applications were restricted to screen-based reading paradigms lacking ecological validity or field studies that suffer from limited experimental control. Our solution is to measure eye-tracking within an immersive VR environment that creates the message delivery and reception context. Specifically, we simulate a car ride down a highway alongside which billboards are placed. The VR headset (HP Omnicept Pro) provides an interactive 3D view of the environment and holds a seamlessly integrated binocular eye tracker that records the drivers' gaze and detects all fixations on the billboards. This allows us to quantify the nexus between exposure and reception rigorously, and to link our measures to subsequent memory, i.e., whether messages were remembered, forgotten, or not even encoded. An empirical study shows that incidental memory for messages differs based on participants' gaze behavior while passing the billboards. The study further shows how an experimental manipulation of attentional demands directly impacts drivers' gaze behavior and memory. We discuss the large potential of this paradigm to quantify exposure and message reception in realistic communication environments and the equally promising applications in new media contexts (e.g., the Metaverse).},

  abstract = {Exposure is the cornerstone of media and message effects research. If a health, political, or commercial message is not noticed, no effects can ensue. Yet, existing research in communication, advertising, and related disciplines often fails to measure exposure and demonstrate the causal link between quantified exposure to outcomes because actual exposure (i.e., whether recipients were not only exposed to messages but also took notice of them) is difficult to capture. Here, we harness Virtual Reality (VR) technology integrated with eye tracking to overcome this challenge. While eye-tracking technology alone can capture whether people attend to messages in their communication environment, most eye-tracking research is bound by laboratory-based screen-reading paradigms that are not representative of the broader communication environments in which messages are encountered. Emerging eye-tracking field research suffers from an inability to control and experimentally manipulate key variables. Our solution is to measure eye-tracking within an immersive environment in VR that resembles a realistic message reception context. Specifically, we simulate driving down a highway alongside which billboards are placed and use VR-integrated eye-tracking to measure whether the drivers look at individual billboard messages. This allows us to rigorously quantify the nexus between exposure and reception, and to link our measures to subsequent memory, i.e., whether messages were remembered, forgotten, or not even encoded. We further demonstrate that manipulating drivers' attention directly impacts gaze behavior and memory.

  year     = {2024},
  abstract = {Shared first authors - Social gaze is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of nonverbal communication. During conversations, it typically operates subconsciously, following automatic co-regulation patterns. However, deviations from typical patterns, such as avoiding eye contact or excessive gazing, can significantly affect social interactions and perceived relationship quality. The principles and effects of social gaze have intrigued researchers across various fields, including communication science, social psychology, animal biology, and psychiatry. Despite its significance, research in social gaze has been limited by methodological challenges in assessing eye movements and gaze direction during natural social interactions. To address these obstacles, we have developed a new approach combining mobile eye tracking technology with automated analysis tools. In this paper, we introduce, validate, and apply a pipeline for recording and analyzing gaze behavior in dyadic conversations. We present a sample study where dyads engaged in two types of interactions: a get-to-know conversation and a conflictual conversation. Our new analysis pipeline corroborated previous findings, such as people directing more eye gaze while listening than talking, and gaze typically lasting about three seconds before averting. These results demonstrate the potential of our methodology to advance the study of social gaze in natural interactions.},

  abstract = {The question of how speakers captivate an audience is central to communication studies. Historically, research has analyzed the speech's content (rhetorical criticism) or its results (expert evaluations), leaving the audiences' real-time responses largely unexplored. This article addresses this gap by introducing communication neuroscience, a field that examines what happens in the brains of audience members as a speech unfolds. We demonstrate how neuroimaging and other physiological measures can track moment-to-moment audience responses. Our focus is on the resonance-like phenomena that occur when effective speeches elicit convergent responses across listeners. We review key methodologies, particularly how inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis allows to map out these convergent responses at the level of the brain and summarize major empirical findings in this area. Finally, the discussion covers the approach's limitations and future potential, outlining its significant implications for rhetorical theory, teaching, and competitive speech and debate.},

  abstract = {Success in public speaking hinges on engaging an audience - a high-stakes social interaction that remains a significant source of anxiety and stress for many. Using a virtual-reality (VR) paradigm, we tested how speakers delivering scientific talks perceive and respond to supportive vs. unsupportive audiences. We collected behavioral (eye contact, speech rate, motion expressiveness/openness), physiological (heart rate, EEG, breathing rate, pupil dilation), and self-report measures to assess audience effects. The unsupportive audience elicited greater negative affect, arousal, and anxiety, and higher perceived cognitive and social effort. Physiologically and behaviorally, speaking to the unsupportive audience slowed the speaking rate and acoustic analyses further indicated greater emotional arousal and vocal dominance in the unsupportive condition. Finally, VR exposure reduced speaking anxiety overall. These findings highlight VR combined with physiological measurement as a powerful approach for investigating audience effects and social-communication processes, with clear implications for augmenting social intelligence and communication skills.},

  year     = {2024},
  abstract = {The eye is the vanguard of the reception process, constituting the point where visual information arrives and is transformed into neural signals. While we view dynamic media contents, a fine-tuned interplay of mechanisms causes our pupils to dilate and constrict over time - and putatively similarly across audience members exposed to the same messages. Research that once pioneered pupillometry did actually use dynamic media as stimuli, but this trend then stalled, and pupillometry remained underdeveloped in the study of naturalistic media messages. Here, we introduce a VR-based approach to capture audience members' pupillary responses during media consumption and suggest an innovative analytic framework. Specifically, we expose audiences to a set of 30 different video messages and compute the cross-receiver similarity of pupillometric responses. Based on this data, we identify the specific video an individual is watching. Our results show that this pupil-pulse-tracking enables highly accurate decoding of video identity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the decoding is relatively robust to manipulations of video size and distractor presence. Finally, we examine the relationship between pupillary responses and subsequent memory. Theoretical implications for objectively quantifying exposure and states of audience engagement are discussed. Practically, we anticipate that this pupillary audience response measurement approach could find application in media measurement across contexts, ranging from traditional screen-based media (commercials, movies) to social media (e.g., TikTok and YouTube), and to next-generation virtual media environments (e.g., Metaverse, gaming).},

This study explores changes in interpersonal synchrony as dyads transition from a casual getting-acquainted conversation to a hierarchical conflict resolution task. Using full-body motion capture we compared temporal alignment patterns in movement activity, head orientation, and body posture of 66 dyads interacting in both conditions. Results show that different coordination measures responded differentially to the situational demands. Time-based measures reveal changes in movement coordination in most body dimensions when transitioning to conflict. Frequency-based measures show differences in the higher frequency bands (1-2Hz) for horizontal and vertical head motions. Correlations between conditions were found in the spatial domain indicating dyad-specific, persistent levels of postural similarity. The results suggest a nuanced understanding of temporal coordination phenomena, highlighting the need to consider different nonverbal subsystems and distinct types of coordination.},

Participants navigate a simulated urban street lined with billboard messages while their visual attention is tracked via eye-tracking. We introduce an inception-style manipulation: overlooked billboards are strategically reintroduced, creating additional exposure opportunities. Our results demonstrate that this subtle manipulation - unnoticed by participants - boosts message retention. This study bridges communication theory and psychology, elucidating the blurred line between voluntary and involuntary information intake in the digital age.
