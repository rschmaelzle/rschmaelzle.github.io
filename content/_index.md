### Research Focus

I study **communication neuroscience**. This involves a radically interdisciplinary approach that integrates theories from communication science, cognitive neuroscience, and psychology.

My goal is to find out how the human brain responds to messages and how brain activity relates to message effects. Much of my work focuses on:

1.  **Media Neuroscience:** How do mass media collectively engage the brains of audience members?
2.  **Health Communication:** Can we predict whether a message will work using neuroimaging?
3.  **Future Media:** Investigating Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as new frontiers for interaction.
