<!-- ACCORDION 1: BRAIN PREDICTION -->
{{< accordion title="Sneak Peek 1: Brain-as-Predictor & Audience Synchrony" >}}

Do you think we could have predicted from your brain activity whether you'd open this field? Indeed, this is increasingly possible and the [lab](http://cn.asc.upenn.edu) in which I did a PostDoc is known for advancing this 'brain-as-predictor' approach. I am currently working on combining inter-subject correlation and related neuroimaging methods with this approach.

The following video illustrates the audience-wide brain response to a health prevention message. You can see that the message evokes similar spatio-temporal brain activity patterns (the left and right brain represent group averages of fMRI activity).

Our results suggest that this approach can be used to derive markers of communication success. If the message had not been received by the brains of individual audience members, they would not exhibit these similar spatiotemporal responses. [My lab at MSU](https://nomcomm.github.io) connects these shared audience responses to what I call *micro-level media effects*, and to campaign success at larger scales.

<!-- ACCORDION 2: VR & EYE TRACKING -->
{{< accordion title="Sneak Peek 2: Virtual Reality & Eye-Tracking" >}}

Virtual Reality (VR) is going to change the way we communicate and interact. In the **CARISMAlab** (Center for Avatar Research and Immersive Social Media Applications), we use advanced laboratory technologies of today to simulate and study the transformative impact of the communication technologies of tomorrow.

For example, one recent line of research uses VR-integrated eye-tracking technology to rigorously study the nexus between exposure to messages, reception mechanisms, and message effects. Our "VR Billboard Paradigm" simulates a drive down a highway along which billboards are placed. VR establishes a realistic communication context and people are free to decide for themselves whether to look at a given message.

**Representative publications:**
*   *Schmälzle et al. (2023)* - VR Billboard Paradigm
*   *Bente et al. (2023)* - Emotion Recognition in VR
*   *Jeon et al. (2024), Cho et al. (2024, 2025), Lim et al., (2024)* - VR & eye-tracking for cultural targeting, messaging, inception manipulations, and AI generated messaging

<!-- ACCORDION 3: AI & COMMUNICATION -->
{{< accordion title="Sneak Peek 3: Artificial Intelligence" >}}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has enormous implications for communication because it allows generating messages at scale and in a fully automated fashion. We recognized this potential of AI early on and...
